# Code Refactor
This project involves refactoring an existing website for a marketing agency to meet accessibility standards. The main goal is to optimize the site for search engines and ensure it is accessible to users with disabilities. The refactoring process includes implementing semantic HTML elements, organizing the HTML structure logically, adding accessible attributes to images and icons, ensuring heading attributes are in sequential order, and providing a concise, descriptive title.

## Accessibility Standards
To ensure accessibility, the following criteria have been met:

Semantic HTML Elements: Semantic HTML elements have been utilized throughout the source code to enhance readability and accessibility.
Logical Structure: HTML elements have been structured logically, independent of styling and positioning, to improve accessibility and maintainability.
Accessible Alt Attributes: Image and icon elements contain descriptive and accessible alt attributes to assist users with disabilities.
Sequential Heading Attributes: Heading attributes have been organized in sequential order to improve document structure and accessibility.
Concise Title Elements: Title elements contain concise and descriptive titles to provide context for users and improve search engine optimization.
## Technical Improvements
In addition to meeting the accessibility standards, the following technical improvements have been implemented:

Functional Links: All links within the application have been verified to ensure they function correctly.
Consolidated CSS: CSS selectors and properties have been consolidated and organized to follow a semantic structure, improving code efficiency and maintainability.
Commented CSS: The CSS file has been properly commented to provide clarity and understanding of styling decisions.
